After that period, the moment you break your fast (\"breakfast\") becomes your body's new morning.\n\nTo avoid jet lack you can adjust your body's clock to the new time zone by applying this technique. Simply enter your departure time zone (usually your home's), destination time zone and arrival time. Famish will tell you when to stop and start eating.\n\nDepending on your flight times and sleep schedule, adjust your break fast time forward if you will be asleep instead of waking up early to eat. The fast needs to be at least 10-12 hours to be effective.";
